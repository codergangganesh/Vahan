**Live URL**: https://vahan-seven.vercel.app/


Vahan Bazar is a modern two-wheeler marketplace web application that connects buyers, sellers, and dealerships in a single platform. Users can browse bikes, scooters, and electric vehicles (EVs), search and filter by brand, price, or fuel type, view detailed specifications with images, compare models side by side, use EMI and fuel cost calculators, check upcoming launches, explore showrooms, and book test rides or sell used bikes.




## ‚ö†Ô∏è SECURITY NOTICE

**Important**: This repository previously contained exposed Supabase credentials in the `.env` file. These credentials have been:
1. Removed from the git history
2. Invalidated in Supabase
3. Replaced with placeholder values

If you have cloned this repository before September 27, 2025, please pull the latest changes to get the updated `.env` file with placeholder values.

For security reasons, you should never commit sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, or other secrets to a public repository. Always use environment variables and include `.env` in your `.gitignore` file.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Git Configuration

### Git Ignore
The project includes a comprehensive `.gitignore` file that excludes:
- Sensitive environment files (`.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.*.local`)
- Dependency directories (`node_modules`)
- Build outputs (`/dist`)
- Log files and OS-generated files
- Editor-specific files

### Environment Variables
All sensitive configuration is stored in environment variables:
- Supabase credentials
- API keys
- Database connection strings

**Never commit sensitive information to the repository.** The `.env` file in the repository only contains placeholder values.

### Security Best Practices
1. Always use `.env.local` for your actual credentials (this is gitignored)
2. Never share your actual credentials in code repositories
3. Regularly rotate your API keys and credentials
4. Use strong, unique passwords for all accounts
5. Enable two-factor authentication where available

### Environment File Hierarchy
1. `.env` - Contains placeholder values (committed to repository)
2. `.env.local` - Contains actual credentials (gitignored)
3. `.env.example` - Template for creating `.env.local` (committed to repository)

When the application runs, it will load variables in this order, with later files overwriting earlier ones.

## üåê GitHub Workflow

### Pushing Changes to GitHub

1. **Initialize Git** (if not already done):
```bash
git init
git remote add origin <your-repository-url>
```

2. **Stage and commit changes**:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"
```

3. **Push to GitHub**:
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

### Best Practices
- Always pull the latest changes before pushing:
```bash
git pull origin main
```
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Push changes frequently to avoid conflicts
- Never push sensitive information (`.env` files with real credentials)
